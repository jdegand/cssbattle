# CSS Battle Solutions

**Note**: I have stopped doing the daily battle. I completed every daily CSS Battle from 6/28/23 to 1/1/25.

## Thoughts

- With these solutions, you should get close to the Top 100 when you incorporate all the optimized open solutions.
- I don't care about the leaderboard, as I knew I didn't want to dedicate the time necessary to be in the top 50.
- If you look at the `pro` users, you can see how many times they verify solutions, and the attempts can be quite high for most of the top scorers.
- The daily CSS battle is good for engagement, but it is tough to keep up with, and I try to limit the time I spend to 15 minutes max. This can create problems when some daily battles are too difficult for such a time limit. Also, I avoid trying newer techniques to just get the battle done as quickly as possible.
- I feel like the harder main battles typically require 30-45 minutes to achieve 100%.  
- The best solutions from the earliest battles relied on `clip-path` and `unicode`. I feel `gradient` properties have become the preferred approach to achieve a top solution. Also, `border` and `box-shadow` can be important to duplicate items.
- [CSS Nesting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting) is pretty much required for the best solutions.
- Using `clip-path` for triangles is a gamble and can be time-consuming to adjust.
- There have been a few battles that were unsolvable. `Abstract Plate` seemed impossible to solve, and it appears to have been adjusted (or someone posted a solution). The design of `Negative Box` was changed to allow easier completion.  A daily battle was unsolvable, and they adjusted the stats so 100% completion for daily battles was retained for eligible users.
- It is important to note that the battles are designed in Figma. The creators can't verify all battles are solvable ahead of time.
- To get the best solutions, you need to incorporate tools and use generators and online editors.  AI is not much help to CSS golfing.
- You need to use the `Chrome` browser to ensure accurate verification. Even then, the preview is slightly off, and it can be helpful to use the `CSS Battle Previewer 2.0` to improve your solution. However, the previewer is only updated for the main battles.
